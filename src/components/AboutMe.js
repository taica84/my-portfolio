            I create responsive websites that are displayed on all devices desktops and 
            smartphones.
            And Iâ€™m ready to do this for you, before we start developing your website,
             we will discuss all the  details of your niche with you, I will conduct a 
             survey of your competitors and make a list of their advantages and weaknesses.

            All this is necessary to give your customers something that your competitors 
            do not provide, or to present it too, but better! */}

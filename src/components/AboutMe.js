            Hello! I am Michael. I have been developing websites for over 3 years. I'm Front-End Web Developer. Technologies I use is Javascript ,React.js , MongoDB ,Firebase.

            I create responsive websites that are displayed on all devices desktops and smartphones.

           

            And Iâ€™m ready to do this for you, before we start developing your website, we will discuss all the  details of your niche with you, I will conduct a survey of your competitors and make a list of their advantages and weaknesses.

            All this is necessary to give your customers something that your competitors do not provide, or to present it too, but better!
